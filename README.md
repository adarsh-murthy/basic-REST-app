# basic-REST-app
REST API app that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for an item.
We are using Node, Express 4 and its Router. Mongoose will interact with MongoDB

We will be using http verbs- POST, GET, PUT and DELETE
1. POST- Creates a new object   
2. GET - Displays all the items url   
3. GET with id: Displays the item with that particular id   
4. PUT: Replaces the item with that id with the new item   
5. DELETE: Deletes the item with that id   

First install the node packages by going to the command line and typing:
$ npm install

You must create your database and use its URI.

Run the server. You can use postman to perform the operations.
